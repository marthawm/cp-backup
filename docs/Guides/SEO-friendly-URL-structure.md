#What is a SEO Friendly URL?
SEO Friendly URLs contain keywords that explain the article, and theyâ€™re easy to read by both humans and search engines. They also improve your chances to rank higher in search engines.

Example of a SEO friendly URL:
http://www.codepamoja.com/how-to-install-wordpress/

http://localhost/codepamoja.com/vagrantpress/wordpress/2016/06/20/javascriptbrowser-storage-cookies/

http://localhost/codepamoja.com/vagrantpress/wordpress/#technologies

######Points to consider

1.Use readable Url's only: if humans can;t read or understand your URLs, either can search engines

2.Always use hyphens in urls rather than underscore:google doesn't read underscore

3.Put top content in the root folder:URL strucure can signal top content because it's in your domain

4.Do not use capital letters in the url:URLs are case sensitive,so avoid confusing visitors and search engines.

5.Block bad URLs with robots.txt:Tell search engines to ignore dynamic URLs that point to your canonical URL

6.Add mobile url to the sitemaps:Identify mobile friendly pages in sitemap so they get ranked higher in mobile search results.

7.Use canonical URL, Avoid duplicate content penalty by telling search engines your preffered domain and preffered web pages.

8.UPload favicon :build your brand and build trust with your visitor and search engines

9.Use 301 redirects: Tell google about changes to your URLs so you dn't loose your ranking

10.Add target keywords in URLs:SEarch engines read URLs so they can better connect their users with relevant content
